By Matt Eland (@IntegerMan)

## Description

This project is a hobby project attempting to create some form of a light science fiction game in Vue.js

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```

## Tasks

### Situation Display

-[ ] Render Grid Lines
-[ ] Render a Ship Component
-[ ] Render a Hostile Component
-[ ] Render Ship Components Based on Data
-[ ] Indicate Heading on Ship Components
-[ ] Indicate Name or Designation Under Ship Components

### Simulation

-[ ] Add a playback speed component
-[ ] When not paused, the playback speed component should periodically cause the simulation to advance
-[ ] Simulating should cause ships to move around

## Navigation

-[ ] Allow the player to set a heading
-[ ] Allow the player to set a velocity

## Tactical

-[ ] Allow the player to initiate a jump
-[ ] Allow the player to fire weapons
-[ ] Allow the player to toggle weapon auto-fire
-[ ] Allow the player to set a target
-[ ] Allow the player to toggle auto-targeting

## Flight Ops

-[ ] Allow managing available launch slots
-[ ] Track individual ships in the system by their status
-[ ] Create flight tasks and assign them to individual vessels
-[ ] Alter orders of existing flights

## Engineering

-[ ] Display ship systems
-[ ] Allow viewing and setting power levels
-[ ] Allow prioritizing damage control activities

## Collaboration

-[ ] Introduce a Web Server
-[ ] Recreate simulation logic in F#
-[ ] Add in SignalR Communications
